This project is an upgraded version of the basic blog application developed during Assessment 1. The enhancements include user authentication, an admin panel for managing blog posts and users, and role-based access control. The project was built using Laravel, with Bootstrap for styling and MongoDB as the database. To further improve the application's functionality, I integrated jQuery and DataTables.
### Approach
1. I started by configuring my development environment using the basic blog application from Assessment 1. I then added a new branch, 'feature/auth-admin-panel', to my GitHub repository. This branch was created specifically to implement the new features required for this evaluation.
2. Following the instructions from Lecture 4, I integrated MongoDB with Laravel. This involved installing the laravel-mongodb package via Composer and updating the database configuration in both the '.env' file and config/database.php. 
3. I constructed a role model, as well as the corresponding migration and seeder. The 'user' model and migration were both updated to add a 'role_id' column. During registration, the 'RegisterController' was changed to assign the default 'author' role. In addition, I changed the 'UserSeeder' to create three users with the roles of 'admin', 'author', and 'user'. I also changed the redirection logic to make sure visitors were led to the correct pages based on their roles.
4. I created 'PostController' and 'UserController' in the 'Admin' namespace. These controllers were in charge of managing blog entries and users, respectively. The 'PostController' allowed authors to control their posts, whilst the 'UserController' let administrators manage users and posts. In addition, I made sure that admins and authors with current postings could not be purged.
5. I generated an 'AdminMiddleware' to restrict access to admin-related routes. This middleware was applied to all admin routes, which were defined with an '/admin' prefix. This setup ensured that only authenticated admins could access the admin panel.
6. I utilized a Bootstrap dashboard template from 'https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/' to create an admin layout, 'admin.blade.php'. All views were styled using Bootstrap components to maintain a consistent and responsive design.
7. I thoroughly tested the application to ensure that all features worked as expected. This included testing CRUD operations for both posts and users, verifying that role-based access control was correctly implemented, and confirming that non-admin users could not access the admin panel. 
8. After completing each major step, I committed and pushed the changes to my GitHub repository. This version control practice allowed me to track the project's progress and maintain a clean development history.




#Difficulties and Challenges
1. Setting up MongoDB with Laravel was one of the initial challenges I faced. The MongoDB driver was not identified, resulting in many failures. However, after reviewing the lecture materials and carefully following the setup instructions, I was able to fix these challenges and effectively integrate MongoDB as the application's database.
2. After configuring MongoDB, I encountered a session key duplication error. This problem developed because the session driver was originally set to database in the.env file. I fixed this by setting the SESSION_DRIVER to file, which removed the duplicate session key problem and stabilised the session management process.

#Approaches
- Realized the issue was due to incorrect credentials in the .env file. Double-checked and corrected the details.
- Fixed by carefully reviewing the migration files and adding the necessary fields.
- Thoroughly tested each function and fixed issues by debugging with Laravelâ€™s tools and checking log files.
- Used Git branches for different features and resolved conflicts by carefully reviewing changes.

### User Generated from the Seeder

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
